    "a) The probability of winning $38.7 million jackpot is one in 300 million or we may say it is nearly impossible to win a jackpot.  The report also mentions that the $38.7 million jackpot is the biggest slot machine payout ever and no body wins a such huge jackpot before.  Therefore, the Exclibur can afford to give away millions of dollars on a $3 bet.\n",
