The 25-year-old soft- ware engineer from Los Angeles, whose name was not released at his request, won after putting three $1 coins in a machine at the Excalibur hotel-casino, said Rick Sorensen, a spokesman for slot machine maker International Game Technology.\n",

    "a) The probability of winning $38.7 million jackpot is one in 300 million or we may say it is nearly impossible to win a jackpot.  The report also mentions that the $38.7 million jackpot is the biggest slot machine payout ever and no body wins a such huge jackpot before.  Therefore, the Exclibur can afford to give away millions of dollars on a $3 bet.\n",
